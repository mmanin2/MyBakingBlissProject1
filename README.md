My Baking Bliss is a website I developed based off of my wife's real baking blog that she has developed over the past several years. (mybakingbliss.com if you want to compare or try baking) :)
This site is a great resource for anyone looking to find great and easy recipes they can bake at home, or even to glance at some of the photos in the gallery of the delicious food that she makes.
Users can read about what the site is on the home page. There is a page where they can view some recipes to try and bake themselves. There is a gallery for any foodies who would want to see the finished results of the recipes or just appreciate some nice food photography that is attainable to do at home. And the contact page is to get any feedback about the recipes or the website in general.

Technologies used in the website were .html, .css, and .javascript

All other logos and photos were provided by wife.

Some ideas to improve the site - 
1.) Add photos to the recipes page so people can see what they are attempting to bake or even to see if it's something they find appetizing by looking at it.
2.) Add links to the photos in the gallery that would take you directly to the recipe that correlates to the photo.
3.) Add some more inputs for the contact page to make it more interesting and fun and maybe get better feedback regarding the site or what kind of recipes people want to see/eat.
